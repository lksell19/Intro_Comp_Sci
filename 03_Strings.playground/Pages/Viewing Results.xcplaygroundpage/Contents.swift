//: In the results sidebar, move the cursor over the line that begins “Why, sometimes I’ve believed…”. When you do, that result will be highlighted and two controls will appear:
//:
//: ![Sidebard Controls](SidebarControls.png)
//: Click the control that looks like an eye. This is the QuickLook control. A popover will appear showing you the full string value.
//: 
//: Move the cursor over the control that looks like an empty circle. A plus sign will appear - this is the _show result_ button. If you click the plus sign, the result of that line of code is added directly below the code. You can click this control again, which will now look like an x, to hide the result.
//:
//: For now, leave the result of the long string showing. Change the values of the spelled out number and the meal. Notice how the result changes inline in the playground.
//:
//: On the next page, take these strings even further.
